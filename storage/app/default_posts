Its alumni are everywhere in digital media. Richard Lawson, now at&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003EVanity Fair\u003C\/em\u003E, had been a secret commenter. Alex Pareene, who brought a sense of the absurd to a presidential campaign that demanded it for sanity\u2019s sake, had started at the company as a 19-year-old dropout from NYU. The embrace of unusual writers led one veteran to describe Gawker as the \u201cisland of the misfit toys\u201d.

Gawker\u2019s politics were progressive, but it shared the belief that the real world was staged. Gawker writers, plugged into the journalists\u2019 gossip networks, looked for the story behind the story, the version that was shared over a drink but less frequently published.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.7; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); max-width: 636px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-left: auto;\"\u003EThe voice was new, too. Elizabeth Spiers\u2019 items would not have been out of place in the newspaper or magazine diary, except she introduced italicized side-remarks that made the stories seem more intimate, an article annotated by a friend.

It\u2019s difficult to recall now, but at Gawker\u2019s founding there was a sense that the internet was a free space, where anything can be said. An island off the mainland, where people could be themselves. Where writers could say things that would get you fired in an instant from a print publication. Where you could say what you thought without fear of being fired, or sued out of existence.

The system is still there. It pushed back. The power structure remains. There are just some new people at the apex, prime among them the techlords flush with monopoly profits.

Nick Denton didn\u2019t give me much direction before he hired me to edit the site in 2008. The morning he met me at 210 Elizabeth Street, carrying his 27-inch iMac underarm from his apartment as my company computer, he showed me my desk, told me I was in charge, then disappeared for a week. I was terrified. Fans (and enemies) of Gawker typically haze new editors by demanding an explanation of how they plan to carry on the traditions of the editors that came before and aside from what I\u2019d mumbled through during my job interview at a SoHo bar a few weeks prior to that morning, I had bupkis.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.7; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); max-width: 636px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-left: auto;\"\u003ETrying to get my bearings in those early days, I began darting at random through the&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/\" style=\"color: rgb(226, 90, 72);\"\u003EArchive.org\u003C\/a\u003E&nbsp;history of&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/gawker.com\/\" style=\"color: rgb(226, 90, 72);\"\u003EGawker.com\u003C\/a\u003E&nbsp;until that notion of a Gawker monolith I had shared with other outsiders faded away: The site was barely recognizable from year to year, through redesigns and editorial personnel changes.

Gawker was only whatever the people running it at the time wanted it to be, and Nick\u2019s best idea was to continually stock the site with people who wanted to do good, despite what he liked to say.

This is the equivocation we make when we contend with the horror of mortality. To stand before the body of the dead and tell the truth about the transgressions it committed in life is impermissible, an insult to the survivors who gather together to weep by the side of the grave. Even though the deceased would not have extended the same courtesy to others while it was still alive, the greatest tribute we could pay is to honor it with hypocrisy and stay silent about its monstrous misdeeds. As Gawker is lowered into the ground, a descent we will all follow down at some point, better that we bow our heads and mark its passing with the solemnity due to the occasion. Now is not the time to reflect on the terrible crimes it committed in life; now we stifle our tongues so that they might not erupt into utterance of our unkind thoughts. Death has taken its due and our quiet is the only appropriate response during the ceremony. Although I gotta say, does anyone think it\u2019s a good idea to let Nick Denton enter new arenas in which he can work his evil? Did anyone think this through at all? At least with Gawker we had him quarantined to a quiet corner of the web. Who even knows what he could do on a larger stage? His dark genius will consume us all. I\u2019m sorry, I spoke out of turn. I will do a better job of controlling my emotions going forward. Farewell, Gawker.

My guilt wasn\u2019t exactly Gawker-specific: I would have felt self-recrimination anywhere I worked because I blush when I tattle, and journalism, no matter where, can sometimes feel a whole lot like tattling. Before Gawker, I spent about five years at the&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003ENew Yorker\u003C\/em\u003E, where I felt some measure of guilt, too, but it wasn\u2019t so acute. I was more junior there, and the magazine has earned itself a sterling reputation, which generally keeps it above the ethical fray that Gawker is not only subjected to, but often courts. To me, though, that was part of the appeal of my new job. I looked forward to the challenge of publishing stories without the protection that a more meritorious reputation might have allowed. And we occasionally did that, sure. But it is easy enough to isolate our best stories from criticism with high-mindedness about bravery and Malcolmian ethics.

If nobody starves and this somehow manages to leave freedom of press unscathed (the latter obviously being the bigger if than the former), what has been crafted is a tale that would seem too outrageous as fiction. Each chapter in Gawker\u2019s trajectory, particularly the last few feverish, increasingly mad entries, has been, objectively, fascinating, and here upon us is a definitive ending, to boot. Ah, the comfort of closure. This sucks right now for many people who are directly affected, but when it\u2019s history and we\u2019re all looking back comfortably, what will remain is that narrative. And really, that\u2019s the best life can give you: enduring narrative. We humans and our things come and go and so little is remembered. We know that Gawker will be remembered.

When the Hogan verdict was announced earlier this year, the schadenfreude-drenched response on social media found many people pretending that Gawker had only run two posts: the Hogan sex tape, and the CFO\/gay escort story of last year. I\u2019m not sure, exactly, why so many people saw fit to distill the millions of words that Gawker has produced down to a few thousand (and about a minute of grainy video). I wonder if it\u2019s easier for some people to simplify either because they aren\u2019t very smart or they don\u2019t like thinking. That sort of revising, of steamrolling nuance, of performative ignorance, though, is something that Gawker, functioning as it was supposed to be functioning, would resist, refute, and ridicule. And now with Gawker not around, there\u2019s one less site invested in calling bullshit, one less site to shake you from the comfort of black-and-white thinking and selective reasoning.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.7; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); max-width: 636px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-left: auto;\"\u003EYou\u2019ll agree or disagree with this assessment, depending on the posts you read, and depending on how invested you are in nuance. Because of Gawker\u2019s breadth, and because it didn\u2019t have so much a single voice as a cacophony of several voices at any given time, the site meant many different things to many different people. What appealed to me, more than anything, was a sensibility that loathed preciousness, that refused to defer to the most sensitive person in the room out of social pressure and smarmy politeness. The site\u2019s run-till-tackled mentality was exhilarating while we ran\u2014I appreciated that no one ever asked me to reduce myself or change to appease readers, especially because I know that even the best-intentioned among a liberal audience can have a hard time swallowing really gay shit. The tackling that finally took place, wrestling Gawker to the ground and then erasing it from the planet, makes me wonder whether time will revise that run as an illusion.
